These incidents include floods, droughts, wildfires, tropical cyclones, blizzards, and snowstorms. We are amid a once-in-a-century pandemic where millions have already lost their lives. We are seeing a war all but in name that is broadcasted on 24/7 news networks. All these incidents affect not just nearby countries but have global impact affecting all countries to a lesser or greater extent. These impacts are not just rocking global geopolitics, they are also tumbling our 21st century inter-connected and inter-reliant economies. One of the most gyrating industries is civil aviation, which at one point collapsed to just 05% of its former self. One lesson learned in the aviation industry is the need for all industry stakeholders to build up operational resilience. Strengthened operational resilience enables all stakeholders to meet risks and threats that can come from anywhere around the globe. This course will explore what is operational resilience, why it is important, and how to achieve it."

Lectures will cover the “full stack” of machine learning, including data cleaning and pre-processing, machine learning, and reinforcement learning. The covered topics include: collecting and processing real-world project data, detecting abnormal data, and imputing missing data; analyzing the data with a variety of machine learning methods including linear & logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA), and advanced machine learning methods (ensemble learning and deep learning). Last, we will introduce reinforcement learning to build autonomous infrastructure systems that learn to make good decisions. One key feature of this course is its application-driven nature. All applications of this course are about smart infrastructure systems. Through those applications, students will know how ML can be applied in their future career and research."

The course starts with an extensive review of statistics, the difference between ML and descriptive statistics, discusses sampling approaches for uncertainty quantification, then covers the fundamental knowledge of supervised learning (Bayesian linear regression, Gaussian processes, deep neural networks), unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixtures), and state space models (Kalman, particle filters). The course will further emphasize on the proper use of ML for civil engineering applications, including incorporating physics-based knowledge (physics-informed ML), dealing with data acquisition challenges (design of experiment, global optimization), and so on. Students will learn to address some unique challenges of applying ML to real-world engineering applications, preparing themselves better in their future career."

For sensing, it covers basic sensing technologies in structural engineering. Students will learn about traditional (e.g., accelerometers) as well as state-of-art sensing technologies (e.g., fiber optic sensing) and their practical applications in civil engineering. It also covers vibration-based structural health monitoring. Students will learn about the fundamentals of structural behavior, and analysis in the time and frequency domain. For data science, this course introduces fundamental knowledge and practical applications of data science and machine learning in the structural engineering context, primarily from understanding and extracting informative patterns from structural sensing data. Students will also learn about the use of relevant software & toolboxes (Python) to apply the discussed data science concepts on structural sensing datasets."

It covers global environmental issues related to climate change resulting from both human activities and natural climate variations, and introduces the basic structures of climate models. This course aims to equip students with a solid understanding of the physical climate system and the underlying principles of current climate assessments. It teaches students which aspects of climate science are well understood and where quantitative uncertainties arise. As climate models are one of our primary tools for predicting and adapting to climate change, it is vital that we appreciate their strengths and limitations. The course includes a combination of lectures, homework assignments, a mid-term exam, and a term project of climate model analysis. The lectures provide students with fundamental knowledge of the physical processes in the climate system and basics of climate modeling.

Students who have passed COMP2633 and have gotten the instructor consent can join this course, they will be working together based on the knowledge they have learned from COMP2633 and this course, forming teams to further investigate various advanced topics related to the more practical side of cybersecurity. They will then join the various cybersecurity competitions. The students will get 2 credits for successfully completing this course. Contest-type “attack and defend” programming problems (also known as Capture-The-Flag, CTF, problems) will be employed throughout this course to practically train the students for the cybersecurity contests. The topics covered will include but not limited to binary analysis, cryptography, web exploitations, and packet capture analysis. These topics will be covered in the practical attack-and-defend context. Recent developments in the topics will also be investigated by students via CTF problem solving. Instructor's approval is required."

Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment."

Students will create music remixes, music/video/actor mashups, and plot twists in their music video storytelling. It will give students a chance to work with emerging video technologies such as deepfakes. Whether students have music or video background or not, this course will provide them a chance to create like a sound designer and director. For each of their music video creations, students will also create a behind-the-scenes commentary video that describes what they did and how they did it. They will share their creations and commentaries in class, and learn from and be inspired by one another."

Thus, the computation in the training or inference of the foundation model could be one of the most important workflows running on top of modern computer systems. This course unravels the secrets of the efficient deployment of such workflows from the system perspective. Specifically, we will i) explain how a modern machine learning system (i.e., PyTorch) works; ii) understand the performance bottleneck of machine learning computation over modern hardware (e.g., Nvidia GPUs); iii) discuss four main parallel strategies in foundation model training (data-, pipeline-, tensor model-, optimizer- parallelism); iv) real-world deployment of foundation model including efficient inference and fine-tuning."

The relevant foundation models form the basis of state-of-art systems and become ubiquitous in solving a wide range of generative tasks in computer vision, for instance. With the unprecedented potential capabilities, these models also give rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover state-of-the-art research topics, starting with technical foundations (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning), fine-tuning and adaptation, system design, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to routinely read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses before and are familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers."

In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes. For BBA(ECON), BSc(ECOF) and BSc(MAEC) first and additional majors students."

In view of these, research on the decision making and strategic interaction under risk and uncertainty have been extremely active for the past few decades. This course aims to provide an introduction to this exciting field of research and suggestions for further exploration. The first part of the course is devoted to the economics of uncertainty and covers topics including the expected-utility model, market allocation of risks and asset pricing. The second part of the course is devoted to the economics of information and covers topics including moral hazard, bargaining, auction theory, mechanism design, and information aggregation in the market."

This is accomplished by making psychologically-sound assumptions about preferences, beliefs, and constrained maximization to account for a wide range of behavior. The course covers three topics: (1) decision making under risk (loss aversion, probability weighting, reference dependence); (2) decision making across time (self-control, timing preference), (3) other-regarding preference (altruism, fairness, reciprocity). Evidence from financial market, saving behavior, labor market and other areas will be used to show how behavioral economics can be fruitfully applied to yield important insights into behavior under different settings. The course emphasizes the interplay among observable behavior, underlying psychology, and economic models. Overall, this course aims to help you develop skills on (1) how to incorporate psychology could help explain economic behavior, (2) how to apply behavioral economics to various economic and business settings."

The learning goal of this course is to be able to understand, design, and implement effective empirical strategies to support empirical claims, particularly causal claims, at the level required for professional researchers of empirical microeconomics. These empirical strategies include randomized experiments with and without compliance, regression discontinuity, the difference-in-difference, and recent techniques such as causal machine learning. In addition, I expect students to understand how to write code in R to perform simulation, estimation, and inference. Finally, I also expect students to learn how to read empirical microeconomics papers critically."

Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F."

But with vague “green promises,” complex ingredient lists, and opaque production processes, we often do not know what is inside the products we use and how they were made. This course will investigate everyday products and explore features that make them (un)sustainable by applying a product life-cycle approach. It will also provide insights into the factors that influence our consumption decisions and how consumer behavior can be changed. Students get the opportunity (through small exercises, activities, and discussions) to investigate about consumption in Hong Kong and explore how companies and governments can help individual consumers to make smarter, more sustainable consumption choices."

Called environmental risks, they can affect human health, economic development, and social stability in significant ways. Therefore, it is crucial to use scientific methods, tools, and frameworks to assess and manage these risks effectively. In this course, students will learn the concepts, principles, and methods of environmental risk assessment and management. They will also learn how to identify, quantify, assess, mitigate, and disclose environmental risks and opportunities in environmental policies, projects, or actions. Students will explore the causes, impacts, and responses of different types of environmental risks. They will also consider how these risks intersect with social justice issues, and how they can challenge and transform the power structures and inequalities that underlie environmental challenges. Finally, students will apply their knowledge and skills to real-world case studies, using various tools and frameworks, as well as understand the importance of transparent environmental risk reporting in corporate finance."

In order to support and grow the structured product business, a variety of functions or roles are developed in the financial industry, including traders, quants, structurers, and sales, etc. at investment banks or relationship managers and product specialists at private banks. As a result, all the financial practitioners are assumed to have basic and practical knowledge about structured products. This course is designed for students who are pursuing front-office careers at investment banks, private banks, or asset management companies. It covers basic concepts of structured products, introduces popular products in the market (e.g., principal protected notes and equity-linked notes), and discusses the landscape of product manufacturing and distribution process. It focuses on applications rather than theory by illustrating real-world examples as well as their practical implementations in the industry."

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F."

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality."

For the concept of love, love as benevolence in Confucius’ and Mencius’ thoughts and love as universal love in Mohism will be compared and explored. For the concept of death, a naturalistic view of death in contrast to death viewed by Chinese Buddhism and religious Taoism will be introduced. A Confucian view of death will be put forward as a dialectical unity of the previous two seemingly contradictory views of death. As for the concept of human nature, various traditional views of human nature will be discussed and a suggestion is given to explain why Mencius’ idea that human nature is good triumphs over other views and becomes the orthodox view of human nature in the Chinese tradition."

The course will discuss topics such as the invention and innovation of the telephone; the attempt to predict earthquakes; how citizen science saved birds and humans from chemical poisoning; the modern survival of ‘traditional’ Chinese medicine; shifting ideas about robots; and how and why young people invented the personal computer, among others. By the end of the course, students will have a much clearer picture of how science, technology, and medicine are co-produced socially and culturally, and be able to apply those lessons to the world we live in now."

Situating art and digital culture within a cross-disciplinary context, the course also considers the following key issues: how do digital technologies change our art, culture, and contemporary life? How does art in the digital age define key issues in the digital world such as privacy, copyright, and identity? How can we create art through interdisciplinary practice? Students will learn to analyze new forms of art and related technologies, and to discuss the key issues of the body, identity, and surveillance in the digital age."

The language of individuals and/or institutions will be analysed in depth, with reference to critical theories of society, ideology and discourse. The course also aims to raise awareness of how language is used to create and maintain power through narratives of identity. Case studies will be presented, with a view to deconstructionist analysis on the role of language in producing and reproducing ostensibly stable ‘identities’ along binary lines such as masculine/feminine, Western/Asian and straight/queer. The course also investigates how humans perform other types of social difference and belonging such as ethnicity and social class."

Through discussions based on a combination of selected readings, films/videos, and music recordings, students will not only get acquainted with popular music well beyond their own or what they normally listen to; they will also gain alternative perspectives on what constitutes \"popular music\" in different East Asian contexts and their significance."

What are the stories told once and again in Chinese culture? Is it true that each retelling is different? Or do things stay more or less the same despite changes of time? Are there perennial themes that thread through Chinese civilization? Is this a valid question? In this course, we engage these questions by putting examples in Chinese literature and culture from the past and the present into dialogue. Taking a transmedia approach, this course brings in both textual and visual materials from history, literature, and cinema. By juxtaposing materials of relevance from different times and carried by various media, we explore continuities and discontinuities in Chinese culture as well as the possibilities and limits each historical moment offers for cultural transformation."

        "description": "Modern portfolio theory started with Harry Markowitz's 1952 seminal paper \"Portfolio Selection.\" He put forth the idea that risk-adverse investors should optimize their portfolio based on a combination of two objectives: expected return and risk. Until today, that idea has remained central in portfolio optimization. However, the vanilla Markowitz portfolio formulation does not seem to behave as expected in practice and most practitioners tend to avoid it. During the past half century, researchers and practitioners have reconsidered the Markowitz portfolio formulation and have proposed countless of improvements and alternatives such as robust optimization methods, alternative measures of risk, regularization via sparsity, improved estimators of the covariance matrix, robust estimators for heavy tails, factor models, volatility clustering models, risk-parity formulations, index tracking, etc. This course will explore the Markowitz portfolio optimization in its many variations and extensions, with special emphasis on Python programming."

The unmet needs will be identified by observing the daily routine of real services and people. Research on existing solutions and how to conduct the stakeholder and market analyses will be taught for designing the needs screening matrix in needs selection. Students are going to unlock their creativity potentials through the in-class activities.The new ideas of addressing the unmet needs are generated in which the ideas are grouped ad organized into a concept map. To translate a promising concept from an idea into a rudimentary design, the concept exploration is facilitated by prototyping. The prototypes are tested by the potential users. This course aims to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, analytical, design and project management skills."

It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students’ competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning."

Students will also learn to construct arguments and support claims effectively in an academic style. The course integrates the three elements of communication skills, academic literacy, and culture with a focus on Chinese writing training. The emphasis is on using Chinese to examine and discuss various cultural issues such as language culture. Students can have a deeper understanding of selected cultural issues and be able to discuss relevant topics in Chinese writing."

It increases student awareness of how speaking and presenting creates change and convinces one to take action. As students explore and analyze spoken genres using language and communication theories, they learn how to shape and adapt their language skills, strategies and communication practices to influence various internal and external audiences including customers, co-workers and supervisors.

In addition, mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been successfully developed, making RNAs more exciting and crucial material to learn. The success of making mRNA vaccines encourages scientists to develop mRNA-based drugs to treat different diseases in the future. This experiential learning course focuses on applying several essential RNA-related technologies in diagnosing and treating human diseases. The course introduces the basic knowledge of RNAs, fundamental principles on RNA-related technologies, and experimental practices for RNA technologies. After learning the basics of RNAs and the principles of six RNA technologies, students will work in teams to develop their projects, and design experiments to make their RNA-related products. By the end of the course, each team will conduct experiments, collect the data, and present and discuss their results at the end of the course. For LIFS/BIBU students in their third or fourth year of study and students with instructor’s consent only."

Registration of pharmaceutical products (drugs, medical devices, food supplements) is a comparatively new biotechnology‐business model, which has evolved from governmental regulations to public health through the assurance of safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products. This course emphasizes the essential components of pharmaceutical development; discusses the key stages and decision points in the process; and gives a detailed analysis on the quality control and regulatory requirements. The technological and financial requirements of the development of pharmaceutical products are also covered. Professional training in these disciplines, lacking in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, is crucial for students who plan to pursue further studies or develop their career in the biotechnology sectors."

The project will involve the following tasks: 1. Upgrading the LSTM framework: The student will update our previously developed LSTM framework to incorporate environmental factors that influence air pollutant consideration. They will use Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow to implement the updated framework. 2. Model training and evaluation. The student will train the updated LSTM model on the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination (R-squared). By completing the project, the student will gain valuable experience in deep learning, data preprocessing, and environmental science.

Therefore, the efforts in the past decades, developing solar energy science and technology, have been significant. This course will elaborate the key science and engineering topics of solar energies, especially focusing on photovoltaic and photothermal devices. The systematic understanding of basic principles, manufacturing processes, and deployment of these devices can play an important role in our students’ future career as an energy engineer."

The training is project-based to develop the students' knowledge/experience in designing and building a practical mechatronics system (formerly called Industrial Training). Students will work in teams to identify the needs for their designed prototype. Also, students will be given the opportunity to design and build various mechatronics components including electronic circuits, motors, sensors, etc. from CAD drawings, and practise their engineering knowledge through all laboratory sessions. The main goal is to develop and nurture skills in problem-solving, communication, interpersonal interaction, project and time management, etc. via the entire project."

        "description": "What business can generate long-term profit? What is the most important topic in this era? What are the most critical challenges to our human society? All these go to sustainability. From the inception of the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s to the ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, the need for sustainable practices has become increasingly apparent. The rise of solar power, the surge in popularity of electric cars, and the debates surrounding genetically modified food are all indicative of the complex and interrelated issues we face today. Extreme weather events and the ever-pressing threat of climate change further compound the urgency of our situation. As an engineer, your role extends beyond acquiring strong technical knowledge and skills. It necessitates an acute awareness of the urgent social, political, and environmental needs that shape our world. This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools to address these challenges. We will introduce and elucidate the fundamental design concepts, methods, tools, and technologies associated with lean and green manufacturing systems, supply chains, and green energy. It will also encompass the evaluation, design, and maintenance of environmentally friendly products, processes, services, and policies. Note that knowledge of Industrial Ecology and Sustainable Engineering is also a requirement outlined by the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (HKIE) accreditation criteria."

What competitive opportunities are created for firms and what do they have to do to seize these opportunities? Lessons from the course will be interest to the students of strategy and the environment. Restricted to MGMT and BBA students."

Along with changing attitudes, new global regulatory CSR requirements are increasingly putting firms under pressure to demonstrate positive social and environmental impacts, while maintaining their commitments to investors. Students will investigate how actual firms are managing these pressures while continuing to address the needs of their stakeholders. Incorporating aspects of the benchmark standards such as the GRI and various ESG (Environmental Social Governance) initiatives will help students to strengthen their own knowledge, skill, and attitudes in this area. The course has an embedded project, with direct links to one or more businesses, which will give students the necessary practical grounding for effectively understanding the challenges of CSR in the contemporary business environment."

Influencing others also requires productive working relationships. This course is designed for full-time MBA students who may spend part of their careers in roles where they will advise clients: consultants (including “in-house”), investment bankers, client relationship managers, etc. The lessons can also be applied to a range of other business relationships you will need (with supervisors, colleagues, direct reports, JV partners, etc.). You may also hire advisors in the future. Understanding the principles of effective advisory relationships can help you choose the right advisors and establish productive relationships. The course will primarily focus on the ‘day-to-day’ client relationship practices that will help establish you as a competent professional, a trusted advisor, and an influential change leader. As a secondary benefit, you will gain an appreciation for how high performing professional service firms operate. To maximize your learning, we will identify specific ways you can put these insights to work during internships or your first job after graduation. Graded P or F."

It centers on an experiential learning program that will require students to develop and pitch an innovation-oriented project. Depending on the student’s career and life goals, this project may consist of a business plan for a startup, a project proposal for their corporate employers, or a new business line for their family businesses. At the end of the course, students will pitch their proposals to a panel of successful innovators whose careers spanned across intrapreneurship, entrepreneurship, and venture capital. Throughout the process, students will experience personal self-discovery and learn about practical tools for pursuing a career in innovation. The course is taught by two instructors: an academic turned entrepreneur and a product manager who began as an intrapreneur before becoming an entrepreneur and later, a venture capitalist."

The course will begin with a theoretical introduction about the nature of the ancient scripts and modern writing systems from historical and comparative perspectives, followed by a systematic exploration of the internal structure of Chinese script in accordance with a newly-developed framework, i.e., the three-principle theory of Chinese script, by which thousands of characters coming from the archeological materials such as jiaguwen (oracle bone inscriptions), jinwen (bronze inscriptions) and jianbowenzi (bamboo and silk scripts) can be appropriately analyzed and classified. This course also offers a critical survey of important issues related to Chinese script in modern times, including simplification, Romanization (Latinization), recognition, and adaptability to various Sinitic and Sinosphere languages, taking into consideration research in general linguistics, sociolinguistics, and heritage history.

This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F."

In recent years, quantum information processing (QIP) has emerged as one of the “most fiercely competitive in today’s world of technology”. This course offers an introduction to the past, present and future of QIP. The theme is to explain the major ideas and issues in QIP, and how this new technology will change our understanding of information processing. The course starts from a gentle introduction to quantum theory without assuming any physics background, then moves to the key applications of QIP including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication. Besides theory, demonstrations and hands-on experiences with quantum hardware will also be given. Students will benefit from learning quantum information technology in an interdisciplinary environment, with knowledge and skills for comprehending the fast-paced developments in today’s technological world."

        "description": "Advances in science and technology over the past century have created many unprecedented and still unresolved global security challenges for policy makers and the public. The invention of nuclear weapons during World War II led Einstein to conclude that “the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking.” Security concerns and government-sponsored research programs later combined to shape the Cold War arms race between the United States and Soviet Union. Many military and technical innovations resulted; these include precision-guided intercontinental ballistic missiles, spy satellites, and global navigation satellite systems, but also the modern electronic computer and computer networks, which became the basis for the internet. Recent developments in biotechnology and digital communication and control raise the prospect of possible new kinds of warfare. This course will provide students with a basic technical understanding of some of the critical technologies that are relevant to national and global security and will equip them with the skills to better assess the challenge of developing effective policies to manage such technologies. Case studies will include nuclear weapons and their proliferation, delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, biotechnology and biosecurity, cyberwarfare, quantum technologies, autonomous weapons and human-level machine intelligence."

        "description": "The impact of climate change on humanity and ecosystems is broader and more severe than anticipated. Urgent and systemic transitions are required to ensure a future with net zero emissions and climate resilience, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, achieving climate goals faces significant challenges, one of most important being the investment gap. First, existing funding flows fall far below the required scale for the future. Second, the growth momentum of the private sector remains insufficient. Third, limitations in fund allocation result in inadequate support for the most vulnerable sectors, industries and groups of population, with over 90% of funds directed toward climate mitigation and less than 10% toward adaptation. In short, accelerating climate action is only feasible with a several-fold increase in financing. The first part of this course introduces students to the foundations of green and sustainable finance, such as its definition, markets and instruments. The second part of this course follows the CFA Institute’s Certificate in ESG Investing curriculum to make sure that the students are equipped with the most up to date information on green and sustainable finance. At the end of the semester, students should have a strong background to be able to study for the certification, which will give them a cutting edge when applying for jobs related to ESG and sustainability."

        "vector": "[3-0-0:3]",
        "description": "The East Asian developmental state model represents a unique blend of state-led macroeconomic planning, heavily interventionist industrial policies, severe labor suppression, and capitalist markets. Despite intermittent financial crises, cronyism, and corruption, it has been credited with producing the most impressive economic growth miracles of the 20th century, including but not limited to that of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and even Mainland China since Deng Xiaoping’s experiments with reform and opening up, leading many experts and policymakers to refer to the region as the “growth driver” and “anchor of stability” of the global economy. The model has dominated the political and economic landscape of East Asia from the end of World War II to the mid-1980s, when the rise of neoliberalism gradually shrunk the policy space for state intervention, and successive waves of democratization, as incomplete and flawed as they sometimes were, placed limits on the severity of labor suppression, putting in question the continued feasibility and even desirability of the model. However, in the 21st century, at least three major developments have resulted in the contemporary resurgence of the East Asian developmental state model, albeit in an evolved form: (1) greater acceptance and even demand for increased state intervention following neoliberalism’s retreat in the aftermath of the global financial crisis; (2) increased protectionism as an integral part of the new Cold War race for technological supremacy between the United States and Mainland China (especially in terms of advanced semiconductors and artificial intelligence); and (3) the deglobalization and regionalization of value chains following the Covid-19 pandemic. In this course, we will analyze the historical and contemporary application of the East Asian developmental state model in a wide variety of political and economic contexts, its merits and demerits in these contexts, and its potential to further evolve and adapt to new geopolitical and geoeconomic realities. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on state-market relations, industrial and labor policies, and technological upgrading."

Its effects are wide-ranging, with corruption having been found to distort human judgment, warp the organizational cultures of governmental and business institutions, undermine economic and political development, increase poverty, compromise human rights, corrode the integrity of economic and political systems, cause extreme inequalities, destroy public confidence in governments and markets, and undercut environmental protection and climate change policies. In this course, we will connect theory with practice to identify the causes and consequences of public and private sector corruption in different policy areas and contexts, and analyze the effectiveness of a wide variety of responses, measures, and strategies designed to prevent and combat it. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, with a particular focus on ethics and integrity, good governance, and the role of modern technologies in both facilitating and fighting corruption."

Tomorrow’s employees and executives may not need the advanced skills of a data scientist, but they must be data literate. Therefore, there is a need to bring together data skills and business management by introducing a common core course, specializing at applying data analytics techniques to business scenarios for the implementation of business intelligence. The aim of this course is to introduce the general workflow of business intelligence and various applications of data analytics models in business scenarios. The course also focuses on an analysis of the strengths, limitations, causes and benefits of the use of business intelligence. The course also includes hands-on practical exercises by using data mining and statistics models on real business data sets."

        "description": "This two-credit course, taught by an economist who previously served nearly 15 years in the Singapore government and is currently a professor of practice in public policy at HKUST as well as an economics consultant, looks at how economic development has occurred in east Asia. It emphasizes the importance of land and agricultural reforms, export-led industrialization, financial repression, technology upgrading, and increasing economic complexity. In so doing, the course challenges conventional models that focus on freeing up markets, financial liberalization, and a neutral, non-interventionist state. The course will also help students deepen their understanding of growth opportunities for businesses in Asia, either from a corporate strategy and operations perspective or from an investor perspective. The course comprises two parts. In the first part of course, students are introduced to key concepts in macroeconomics and development economics, focusing on how successful development in economies such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and more recently mainland China, relied much more on activist, developmental states than standard economic models prescribe. In the second part of the course, we look at the challenges of economic development after the global financial crisis of 2007-2012, and which the pandemic of 2020-2022 has made more salient. We examine a selection of major economic trends after the global financial crisis: the middle-income trap in many Asian developing countries; slower, more fragmented globalization; pressures for decoupling or de-risking; automation and the risk of premature deindustrialization; ESG objectives and how that might affect growth prospects of developing countries; and the headwinds confronting the Chinese."

Co-taught by lecturers from chemistry and life science, respectively, approximately one half of the course deals with an introduction into the chemical universe that makes life possible; simple sugars and complex carbohydrates, amino acids, peptides and proteins, DNA, RNA and lipids. Interactions and laws governing these substances and ways we can observe what they are doing are covered. The other half of the course is about how these compounds are involved in some of the basic mechanisms of life; from the functions and evolution of membranes to cells all the way up to humans and other organisms; areas covered include genetics and genomics, diseases, food and health, and biotechnology."

This course is deliberately designed as complementary to formal and theory-based introductory  statistical courses and substantive and history-based social science courses. This course introduces basic knowledge about quantitative data analysis from a social scientific perspective, from data generating processes to causal inference. Devoted computing sessions, a signature feature of this course, demonstrate hands-on techniques, such as data extraction, data management, variable manipulation, and  descriptive analysis. Students will have the chance to implement ideas and methods from the lectures through in-class exercises, as well as a project, by applying what they learn from real-world data. Upon completion of this course, students should have acquired useful skills for social data analysis as well as better understanding of social science research. Enrolment is restricted to students admitted to BSc in Quantitative Social Analysis from 2022-23 and onwards."

In less than forty years the region transformed from a backwater to an engine of advanced manufacturing and services. It has lifted millions of people out of poverty, provided homes and communities, and become a node in a global network of megacity regions responsible for much of the world’s economic dynamism. Yet, aspirations are higher. Government, businesses, and others want to harness the region’s synergies to compete with other highly developed bay areas. Becoming an innovative high quality living region is the goal. To understand the region’s successes and challenges, the course examines the GBA’s evolution through the agglomeration processes of external economies, governance and urbanization. These processes led the GBA’s development and will determine its future - in terms of continued economic development and more importantly in terms of the wellbeing of the GBA’s people."

In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods.

Using this perspective puts the logic of statistical inference for both experimental and non-experimental studies within the same framework. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, the course also outlines how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves a set of assumptions or substantive factual information about how the natural world produced the data. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."

It then examines how the rules governing economic activities have been redefined in major economic sectors since 1978. It also highlights the main features of the new, capitalistic economy and reflects on the issues and challenges that have emerged during the transformation of the economy."

Using this perspective puts the logic of statistical inference for both experimental and non-experimental studies within the same framework. Though randomized experiments serve as the gold standard for causal inference, the course also outlines how it may sometimes be reasonable to treat non-experimental data as if it had been drawn from an experiment. Usually, this involves a set of assumptions or substantive factual information about how the natural world produced the data. Research designs and methods covered include randomized experiments, matching, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs."
