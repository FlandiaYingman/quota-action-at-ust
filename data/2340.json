The objective of this course is to develop the ability to control an electrochemical reaction, and to obtain hands-on experience on a practical engineering project, especially in chemical engineering field. Students will be given the opportunity to interact with each other, to integrate the learning experience to design and build a device, and chances to prepare for starting their future career in engineering. It is a student-led project, designed to motivate students for engineers. Graded DI/PA/F. Enrollment in the project course require instructor's approval."

With an aim to help students who have limited exposure to construction practice, this course uses a Capstone project to help the students to form a comprehensive view of a construction project, including site layouts, construction practice, contract type, and construction methods. Students would be required to apply the knowledge learned to describe a real-life construction project and critically analyze the construction activities.",

It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement."

        "description": "Percolation theory is the study of random connected components that appear if one removes edges or vertices of a graph according to a certain prescribed rule. The particularly simple model of Bernoulli percolation has originally been devised as a description for porous media by Broadbent and Hammersley in the 1950s, and its mathematically rich phenomenology has attracted much attention since then. The principal objective of this independent study course is to study important techniques used in Bernoulli percolation on Zd, d ≥ 2, in particular the FKG- and BK-inequalities, enhancements, exponential decay, renormalization, the Burton-Keane argument, and planar techniques such as Russo-Seymour-Welsh (RSW) theory. Towards the end, certain extensions of Bernoulli percolation models (correlated percolation, continuum percolation) will also be shortly discussed. Some familiarity with concepts from measure-theoretic probability theory (on the level of MATH 2431 Honors Probability) is helpful to follow this course. Students should seek the course instructor's approval to take this course."

It will explore how to make cities more sustainable in terms of environmental, social, and economic aspects and equip students with the theoretical and methodological tools to draft and analyze strategies and their viability. The course will also introduce and evaluate various approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life, such as localization, industrial symbiosis, and ecological restoration and review processes of reducing the dependence on external resources and increasing the local production and consumption of goods and services. These approaches will be examined in different contexts and scales, from local to global, and from individual to collective.",

Compare and contrast different models and theories of urban sustainability and their implications for urban policy and practice.\n2. Explain and analyze the concept of urban sustainability and its social, economic and environmental dimensions.\n3. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and tools for collecting and analyzing data on urban sustainability issues and solutions.\n4. Develop strategies to counteract or mitigate the impact of urban population trends and climate change on urban sustainability and resilience.\n5. Evaluate the benefits and challenges of various approaches to foster more sustainable and resilient forms of urbanization and urban life.\n6. Develop and communicate interdisciplinary and integrative strategies to address complex urban challenges and opportunities.\n7. Critically reflect on their own role and responsibility as urban citizens and professionals in promoting urban sustainability and resilience.\n8. Demonstrate ethical and professional practices in working with diverse urban communities and stakeholders to promote urban sustainability and resilience."

Why does global inequality keep increasing in most of the world, and why has this problem been ignored for such a long time? Why are some countries able to develop and others not? And perhaps most uncomfortably, is it possible to achieve universal progress on poverty, inequality, and development, or does progress necessarily mean that some people and countries fall behind as others advance in the current systemic configuration? In this course, we will draw on key theories of political economy and development as well as on long-standing debates in the history of development thought and practice to try and answer these and other related questions, and critically evaluate a wide range of mainstream and alternative development models and issues, and the complex politics behind them. The course will be useful to those pursuing a career in the public and private sectors, international organizations, civil society organizations, journalism, or academia, as well as to anyone wanting to understand poverty, inequality, and development better and to make a difference."
